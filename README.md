## Introduction
![Humorous image of software quality estimation as a count of how many expletives you shout when reading code (http://www.osnews.com/images/comics/wtfm.jpg)

Software engineering principles, from Robert C. Martin's book [*Clean Code*](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882), adapted for .NET and .NET Core. This is not a style guide. It's a guide to producing readable, reusable, and refactorable software in .NET and .NET Core.

Not every principle herein has to be strictly followed, and even fewer will be universally agreed upon. These are guidelines and nothing more, but they are ones codified over many years of collective experience by the authors of *Clean Code*.

Inspired from [clean-code-javascript](https://github.com/ryanmcdermott/clean-code-javascript) and [clean-code-php](https://github.com/jupeter/clean-code-php)
